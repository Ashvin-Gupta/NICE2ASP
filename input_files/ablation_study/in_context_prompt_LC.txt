You are an expert in answer set programming logic.

Given a problem in natural language, translate the problem into ASP rules using the provided constants and predicates.
Do this only for all the rules within Problem 7 as the other rules are examples which you should closely study, learn from and apply the patterns present in the examples to Problem 6.

Return the constraints under the rule they refer to in the form of:
[rule_number] 
[constraint1].
[constraint2].
...
Where [rule_number] refers to the rule number in the guidelines, e.g 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.

Background knowledge that will help:
- Where curly braces are used in the form of x{{}}y, this means that there is at least x and up to y of the options inside the curly braces.
- offered(X) :- offer(X). This is important for temporal relationships between rules.
- Age can be represented as 'age(X), X>=number' where number is the age of the patient.

Problem 1:
Offer contrast-enhanced brain MRI for people with stage III NSCLC who are having treatment with curative intent.

% The ASP rule for this statement is: 
offer("contrast_enhanced_brain_MRI") :- findings("NSCLC", "stage_III"), offer("treatment_with_curative_intent").

% This rule reads as: 
% Offer a contrast-enhanced brain MRI to people who have NSCLC of stage III and are being offered treatment with curative intent.

Problem 2:
Consider an urgent chest X-ray (to be done within 2 weeks) to assess for lung cancer in people aged 40 and over with any of the following:
• persistent or recurrent chest infection
• finger clubbing
• supraclavicular lymphadenopathy or persistent cervical lymphadenopathy
• chest signs consistent with lung cancer

% The ASP rule for this statement is:
consider("chest_X-ray") :- age(X), X>=40, 1{{have("persistent_or_recurrent_chest_infection"); have("finger_clubbing"); have("supraclavicular_lymphadenopathy"); have("persistent_cervical_lymphadenopathy"); have("chest_signs")}}5.

% This rule reads as: 
% Consider an urgent chest X-ray to assess for lung cancer in people aged 40 if they have at least one of the following: persistent or recurrent chest infection, finger clubbing, supraclavicular lymphadenopathy or persistent cervical lymphadenopathy, or chest signs consistent with lung cancer.

Problem 3:
Do not routinely use MRI to assess the stage of the primary tumour (T-stage) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

% The ASP rule for this statement is:
:- have("NSCLC"), offer("MRI"), assess_stage("primary_tumour").

% This rule reads as:
% Remove from the answer set any people who have NSCLC and have had an MRI scan to assess the stage of the primary tumour.

Problem 4:
Confirm the presence of isolated distant metastases/synchronous tumours by biopsy or further imaging (for example, MRI or PET-CT) in people being considered for treatment with curative intent.

% The ASP rule for this statement is:
1{{offer("biopsy");offer("MRI"); offer("PET-CT")}} 3 :- offered("treatment_with_curative_intent"), suspected("isolated_distant_metastases").

% This rule reads as:
% Offer at least one and at most three of the options inside the curly braces (biopsy, MRI or PET-CT) to people who are being considered for treatment with curative intent and have isolated distant metastases.

Problem 5:
Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for lung cancer if they:
• have chest X-ray findings that suggest lung cancer or
• are aged 40 and over with unexplained haemoptysis. [2015]
• have smoked and are not being considered for treatment with curative intent.

% The ASP rule for this statement is:
refer("suspected_cancer_pathway_referral", cancer("lung")) :- findings_from_procedure("chest_X-ray", cancer("lung")).
refer("suspected_cancer_pathway_referral", cancer("lung")) :- age(X), X>=40, have("haemoptysis").
refer("suspected_cancer_pathway_referral", cancer("lung")) :- age(X), X>=40, have("smoked"), not offered("treatment_with_curative_intent").

% This rule reads as:
% Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for lung cancer if they have chest X-ray findings that suggest lung cancer or are aged 40 and over with unexplained haemoptysis.
% Note that we represent the age of the patient in the format age(X), where X is the age of the patient.

Problem 6:
% Offer people with known or suspected lung cancer a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan to further the diagnosis and stage the disease. Include the liver, adrenals and lower neck in the scan.

Constants:
Disease: "lung_cancer".
Imaging: "contrast_enhanced_chest_CT_scan".
Anatomical_structures: "liver", "adrenals", "lower_neck".

Predicates:
offer(I)
include(I, A)
have(D)
suspected(D)

% The ASP rule for this statement is:
% offer("contrast_enhanced_chest_CT_scan") :- 1{{have(cancer("lung")); suspected(cancer("lung"))}}2 .
% 3{{include("contrast_enhanced_chest_CT_scan", "liver"); include("contrast_enhanced_chest_CT_scan", "adrenals"); include("contrast_enhanced_chest_CT_scan", "lower_neck")}} 3 :- offer("contrast_enhanced_chest_CT_scan").
