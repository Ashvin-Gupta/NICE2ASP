You are an expert in classifying constants from text.
Given a problem, extract all different constants and their categories in the form "category: constant_1; constant_2; ...; constant_n". Here, the format of each constant is turned into either an integer or a string surrounded by double quotes, e.g., "some name".
Do this only for Problem 7 where I have given you the categories which do not need changing and some information about what should be included in them.
Start each reply with Constants:


Problem 1:
Offer contrast-enhanced brain MRI for people with stage III NSCLC who are having treatment with curative intent.

Constants:
Disease: "NSCLC".
Finding_of_lung: "stage_III".
Treatments: "treatment_with_curative_intent".
Imaging: "contrast_enhanced_brain_MRI".


Problem 2:
Consider an urgent chest X-ray (to be done within 2 weeks) to assess for lung cancer in people aged 40 and over with any of the following:
• persistent or recurrent chest infection
• finger clubbing
• supraclavicular lymphadenopathy or persistent cervical lymphadenopathy
• chest signs consistent with lung cancer

Constants:
Symptoms: "persistent_or_recurrent_chest_infection", "finger_clubbing", "supraclavicular_lymphadenopathy", "persistent_cervical_lymphadenopathy", "chest_signs".
Information_about_patient: "40".
Imaging: "chest_X-ray".

Problem 3:
Do not routinely use MRI to assess the stage of the primary tumour (T-stage) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

Constants:
Disease: "NSCLC".
Imaging: "MRI".
Finding_of_lung: "primary_tumour".


Problem 4:
Confirm the presence of isolated distant metastases/synchronous tumours by biopsy or further imaging (for example, MRI or PET-CT) in people being considered for treatment with curative intent.

Constants:
Imaging: "MRI", "PET-CT".
Procedures: "biopsy".
Management: "treatment_with_curative_intent".
Disease: "isolated_distant_metastases".

Problem 5:
Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for lung cancer if they:
• have chest X-ray findings that suggest lung cancer or
• are aged 40 and over with unexplained haemoptysis.
• have smoked and are not being considered for treatment with curative intent.

Constants:
Disease: "lung_cancer".
Imaging: "chest_X-ray".
Information_about_patient: "40".
Symptoms: "haemoptysis", "smoked".
Management: "suspected_cancer_pathway_referral", "treatment_with_curative_intent".


Problem 6:
% Offer people with known or suspected lung cancer a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan to further the diagnosis and stage the disease. Include the liver, adrenals and lower neck in the scan.

Constants:
Disease: "lung_cancer".
Imaging: "contrast_enhanced_chest_CT_scan".
Anatomical_structures: "liver", "adrenals", "lower_neck".

Problem 7:

Managements: Concepts related to management of a cancer
Treatments: Concpets related to treating a disease
Anatomical_structures: Anatomical structures of the body
Information_about_patient: Concpets related to demographics of the patient 
Understanding_of_diagnosis: Concepts related to how clear clinician is on the diagnosis
