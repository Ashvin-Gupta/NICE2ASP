You are an expert in classifying constants from text.
Given a problem, extract all different constants and their categories in the form "category: constant_1; constant_2; ...; constant_n". Here, the format of each constant is turned into either an integer or a string surrounded by double quotes, e.g., "some name".
Do this only for Problem 6 where I have given you the categories which do not need changing and some information about what should be included in them.
Start each reply with Constants:

Problem 1:
[People without jaundice who have pancreatic abnormalities on imaging] Offer a pancreatic protocol CT scan to people with pancreatic abnormalities but no jaundice. If the diagnosis is still unclear offer FDG-PET/CT and/or EUS with EUS-guided tissue sampling.

Constants:
Imaging: "pancreatic protocol CT".
Finding_of_pancreas: "pancreatic abnormalities".
Symptoms: "jaundice".
Procedures: "FDG-PET/CT"; "EUS"; "EUS with tissue".
General_findings: "unclear diagnosis".

Problem 2:
[People with obstructive jaundice] Take a biliary brushing for cytology if: endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is being used to relieve the biliary obstruction and there is no tissue diagnosis.

Constants:
Procedures: "bilary brushing"; "ERCP".
Understanding_of_diagnosis: "no tissue diagnosis".
Symptoms: "bilary obstruction", "obstructive jaundice".

Problem 3:
[People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer] Offer surveillance for pancreatic cancer to people with:
• hereditary pancreatitis and a PRSS1 mutation
• BRCA1 or BRCA2, and one or more firstdegree relatives with pancreatic cancer

Constants:
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Management: "surveillance".
Genetic_disease: "hereditary pancreatitis", "PRSS1", "BRCA1", "BRCA2".
Information_about_patient: "firstdegree relatives with pancreatic cancer", "inherited high risk".

Problem 4:
[People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer] Do not offer EUS to detect pancreatic cancer in people with hereditary pancreatitis.

Constants:
Procedures: "EUS".
Genetic_disease: "hereditary pancreatitis".
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Information_about_patient: "inherited high risk".


Problem 5:
Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for pancreatic cancer if they are aged 40 and over and have jaundice.

Constants:
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Symptoms: "jaundice".
Information_about_patient: "40".
Management: "suspected cancer pathway referral".

Problem 6:
