Given a problem and some categorized constants of the form "category: constant_1; constant_2; ...; constant_n", generate the minimum number of predicates to define the relations among the categories of constants. Each generated predicate is of the form "predicate(X1, X2, ..., Xn)" where X1, X2, ..., Xn are different variables and each variable X belongs to one of the categories.
Do this only for Problem 6 where the predicates should be verbs explicitly mentioned in the guidelines. The other problems are examples, follow and learn their pattern closley.
As the guidelines are for one disease, predicates do not need to include the disease most of the time.
Note that in the guidelines, there is sometimes a statement at the start of the paragraph that applies to all the rules in that section.
Start each predicate with - 

Background knowledge that will help:
- As these are medical guidelines often the predicates will be verbs.
- Common predicates include: offer, offered, have, need, findings, findings_from_procedure, refer

Problem 1:
[People without jaundice who have pancreatic abnormalities on imaging] Offer a pancreatic protocol CT scan to people with pancreatic abnormalities but no jaundice. If the diagnosis is still unclear offer FDG-PET/CT and/or EUS with EUS-guided tissue sampling.

Constants:
Imaging: "pancreatic protocol CT".
Finding_of_pancreas: "pancreatic abnormalities".
Symptoms: "jaundice".
Procedures: "FDG-PET/CT"; "EUS"; "EUS with tissue".
General_findings: "unclear diagnosis".


Predicates:
% The categories in Constants include imaging, finding_of_pancreas, symptoms, procedures and general_findings. We use differnt variables I, Fp, S, P and Gf to represent imaging, finding_of_pancreas, symptoms, procedures and general_findings.
% The ASP rule for this statement is: 
% And therefore we offer imaging I or procedure P, have a symptom S, findings Gf from imaging I, and offered imaging I.

offer(I)
offer(P)
have(Fp)
have(S)
findings_from_procedure(I, Gf)
offered(I)

% Note the offered(I) predicate is VERY important here as it allows us to have temporal relationships within our rules.
% Note the predicate findings_from_procedure(I, Gf). This predicate should be used in situations where we have a finding Gf from an imaging I where the finding could be information such as 'diagnosis unclear', 'more information needed', 'localised disease', 'malignant' etc.

Problem 2:
[People with obstructive jaundice] Take a biliary brushing for cytology if: endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is being used to relieve the biliary obstruction and there is no tissue diagnosis.

Constants:
Procedures: "bilary brushing"; "ERCP".
General_findings: "no tissue diagnosis".
Symptoms: "bilary obstruction", "obstructive jaundice".

Predicates:
% The categories in Constants include procedures, general_findings and symptoms. We use different vairiables P, Gf and S to represent procedures, general_findings and symptoms.
% And therefore we offer a procedure P, have a symptom S, findings Gf, and offer procedure P for a symptom S.

offer(P)
have(S)
findings(Gf)
offer(P, S)

Problem 3:
[People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer] Offer surveillance for pancreatic cancer to people with:
• hereditary pancreatitis and a PRSS1 mutation
• BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 or CDKN2A (p16) mutations, and one or more first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer

Constants:
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Management: "surveillance".
Genetic_disease: "hereditary pancreatitis", "PRSS1", "BRCA1", "BRCA2".
Information_about_patient: "firstdegree relatives with pancreatic cancer", "inherited high risk".

Predicates:
% The categories in Constants include disease, management, genetic_disease and information_about_patient. We use different vairiables D, M, Gd and Ip to represent disease, management, genetic_disease, and information_about_patient.
% And therefore we offer Management M for a Disease D, have a Genetic Disease Gd, have Information about the patiet IP and a first degree relative PersonID has with disaease D.
offer(M, D)
have(Gd)
have(Ip)
first_degree_relative(D, PersonID)

Problem 4:
[People with inherited high risk of pancreatic cancer] Do not offer EUS to detect pancreatic cancer in people with hereditary pancreatitis.

Constants:
Procedures: "EUS".
Genetic_disease: "hereditary pancreatitis".
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Information_about_patient: "inherited high risk".

Predicates:
% The categories in Constants include procedures, genetic_disease, management and disease. We use the different variables P, Gd, M and D to represent procedures, genetic_disease, management and disease.
% And therefore we offer procedure P, have a genetic_disease Gd, and have information Ip about the patient.

offer(P)
have(Gd)
have(Ip)

Problem 5:
Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral for pancreatic cancer if they are aged 40 and over and have jaundice.

Constants:
Disease: "pancreatic cancer".
Symptoms: "jaundice".
Information_about_patient: "40".
Management: "suspected cancer pathway referral".

Predicates:
% The categories in Constants include disease, symptoms, information_about_patient and management. We use the different variables D, S, Ip and M to represent disease, symptoms, information_about_patient and management.
% And therefore we refer management M for disease D, have a symptom S, and have information about the patient Age.

refer(M, D)
have(S)
have(Ip)

Problem 6:
