Given the complexity and the detailed nature of the provided guidelines for lung cancer diagnosis and staging, I'll translate a subset of these guidelines into ASP rules. For simplicity, I'll focus on a few key points such as the use of sputum cytology, offering contrast-enhanced chest CT scans, and the conditions under which PET-CT scans should be offered.

### Constants and Predicates

Before diving into the rules, let's define some constants and predicates that will be used:

- Constants:
  - `central_nodule`: Indicates a centrally placed nodule or mass.
  - `decline_invasive_test`: Patient declines or cannot tolerate invasive tests.
  - `known_lung_cancer`: Patient has known lung cancer.
  - `suspected_lung_cancer`: Patient is suspected of having lung cancer.
  - `renal_impairment`: Patient has known renal impairment.
  - `curative_intent`: Treatment is planned with curative intent.

- Predicates:
  - `use_sputum_cytology(Patient)`: Sputum cytology should be used for the patient.
  - `offer_ct_scan(Patient)`: A contrast-enhanced chest CT scan should be offered to the patient.
  - `offer_pet_ct_scan(Patient)`: A PET-CT scan should be offered to the patient.
  - `has_central_lesion(Patient)`: Patient has a central lesion.
  - `has_peripheral_lesion(Patient)`: Patient has a peripheral lesion.
  - `has_enlarged_lymph_nodes(Patient)`: Patient has enlarged intrathoracic lymph nodes.

### ASP Rules

1. 
```asp
use_sputum_cytology(Patient) :- has_central_nodule(Patient), decline_invasive_test(Patient).
```

2. 
```asp
offer_ct_scan(Patient) :- known_lung_cancer(Patient); suspected_lung_cancer(Patient).
offer_ct_scan(Patient) :- not renal_impairment(Patient).
```

3. 
```asp
offer_pet_ct_scan(Patient) :- curative_intent(Patient), (has_peripheral_lesion(Patient); has_central_lesion(Patient)).
offer_pet_ct_scan(Patient) :- has_enlarged_lymph_nodes(Patient), curative_intent(Patient).
```

4. 
```asp
perform_biopsy(Patient) :- has_peripheral_lesion(Patient), curative_intent(Patient).
perform_biopsy(Patient) :- has_enlarged_lymph_nodes(Patient), curative_intent(Patient).
```

5. 
```asp
avoid_mri_for_t_staging(Patient) :- not superior_sulcus_tumour(Patient), nsclc(Patient).
use_mri_for_disease_extent(Patient) :- superior_sulcus_tumour(Patient).
```

6. 
```asp
ebus_tbna_or_eus_fna(Patient) :- has_enlarged_lymph_nodes(Patient), curative_intent(Patient).
```

7. 
```asp
contrast_enhanced_brain_ct(Patient) :- clinical_stage_ii_nsclc(Patient), curative_intent(Patient).
contrast_enhanced_brain_mri(Patient) :- clinical_stage_iii_nsclc(Patient), curative_intent(Patient).
```

### Note:
- The rules provided are a simplified representation and might need adjustments based on the actual ASP system being used.
- The predicates and constants are defined based on the context provided and might need to be adjusted or expanded for a full implementation.
- This example focuses on translating specific guidelines into ASP rules and does not cover all aspects of the provided text.
