Based on the provided guidelines for Problem 6, the following predicates can be defined:

- offer(I) 
- offer(P) 
- have(S) 
- have(Fl) 
- have(Gd) 
- have(Ip) 
- findings_from_procedure(I, Gf) 
- offered(I) 
- refer(M, D) 
- need(Tr) 
- findings(Gf) 
- first_degree_relative(D, PersonID) 
- have(As) 
- consider(P) 
- perform(I) 
- provide(Tr) 
- discuss_at_meeting(D) 
- see_at_clinic(D) 
- provide_support(D) 
- facilitate_communication(D) 
- help_access_advice(D) 

Note: 
- I represents Imaging 
- P represents Procedures 
- S represents Symptoms 
- Fl represents Finding_of_lung 
- Gd represents Genetic_disease 
- Ip represents Information_about_patient 
- M represents Management 
- D represents Disease 
- Tr represents Treatments 
- As represents Anatomical_structures 
- Gf represents General_findings 
- PersonID represents the ID of a person, which can be left blank if unknown. 

These predicates cover various aspects of the guidelines, including offering investigations, having symptoms or findings, referring patients, needing treatments, and providing support. They can be used to represent the relationships between different categories of constants and to define the rules for diagnosing and managing lung cancer.
