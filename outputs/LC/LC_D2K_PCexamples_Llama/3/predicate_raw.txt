Based on the provided guidelines for Problem 6, the following predicates can be defined:

- offer(I) 
- offer(P) 
- have(S) 
- have(Fl) 
- have(Gd) 
- have(Ip) 
- have(Gf) 
- findings_from_procedure(I, Gf) 
- offered(I) 
- refer(M, D) 
- need(Tr) 
- findings(Gf) 
- first_degree_relative(D, PersonID) 
- have(As) 
- perform(P) 
- consider(P) 
- provide(M) 
- facilitate(Tr) 
- see(Person) 
- provide_support(Person) 
- facilitate_communication(Person) 
- help_access_advice(Person) 

Note that some of these predicates may not be directly mentioned in the guidelines, but they can be inferred based on the context and the relationships between different categories of constants.

Here's a brief explanation of each predicate:

- offer(I): Offer an imaging test I.
- offer(P): Offer a procedure P.
- have(S): The patient has symptom S.
- have(Fl): The patient has finding Fl of the lung.
- have(Gd): The patient has genetic disease Gd.
- have(Ip): The patient has information Ip about their condition.
- have(Gf): The patient has general finding Gf.
- findings_from_procedure(I, Gf): The imaging test I resulted in finding Gf.
- offered(I): The imaging test I was previously offered.
- refer(M, D): Refer the patient to management M for disease D.
- need(Tr): The patient needs treatment Tr.
- findings(Gf): The patient has finding Gf.
- first_degree_relative(D, PersonID): The patient has a first-degree relative with disease D.
- have(As): The patient has anatomical structure As.
- perform(P): Perform procedure P.
- consider(P): Consider procedure P.
- provide(M): Provide management M.
- facilitate(Tr): Facilitate treatment Tr.
- see(Person): See person (e.g., a clinical nurse specialist).
- provide_support(Person): Provide support to person.
- facilitate_communication(Person): Facilitate communication for person.
- help_access_advice(Person): Help person access advice.

These predicates can be used to represent the relationships between different categories of constants in the guidelines and to define the rules for diagnosis, treatment, and management of lung cancer.
